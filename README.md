# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Project Overview

Statistical analysis can be especially helpful when companies are evaluating product design and improvement. In this project, AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The vehicle_length and ground_clearance provide non-random amount of variance to the MPG values as p-values are below 0.05.

The slope of the line is not considered to be 0 as the p-value of the model is below 0.05 at 5.35e-11.

This linear model effectively predicts the MPG of MechaCar prototypes as the r-squared value of 0.7149 is a strong level of correlation.
